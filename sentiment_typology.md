## Ambiguous Cases (Standardized Rules)

### Ambiguous → Negative
Label **Negative** if the opener includes:

- Legal pressure (e.g., ICC warrants, investigations).
  
**Examples:**
- "Netanyahu faces wave of condemnation over Gaza plans."
- "Netanyahu visit sparks protests in DC."

### Ambiguous → Neutral
Label **Neutral** if the opener:
- States what Netanyahu said or did, without judgment.
- Reports policy positions without praise/blame.
- Announces plans, meetings, or diplomatic events.

**Examples:**
- "Netanyahu says Israel intends to take over Gaza."
- "Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state."
- "Netanyahu begins high-stakes U.S. visit..."

Default to **Neutral** unless evaluative language is present.

### Ambiguous → Positive
Label **Positive** only if:
- The opener explicitly praises Netanyahu.
- The opener attributes success, statesmanship, or admirable leadership to him.

**Examples:**
- "Avi Benlolo praises Netanyahu's leadership in Congress."
- "Analysts credit Netanyahu for successful negotiation breakthrough."

If praise targets someone else, the headline is **Neutral**.
