## 3. Gaza War Military Operations & Strategy

### Definition
This category includes news about **airstrikes, troop movements, offensives, strategic doctrine, military escalation, or battlefield status** in Gaza.

### Included Cases (Examples)
- **Announcements of new offensives or invasions**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu announces date set for Rafah ground offensive”
- **Statements about intensifying operations**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu orders ‘powerful’ strikes on Gaza”
- **Military outcomes and tactical assessments**  
  *Example:* “IDF spokesman says Hamas cannot be defeated”  
- **Occupation or control plans for Gaza**  
  *Example:* “Israel intends to take over Gaza”
- **Ongoing battlefield actions**  
  *Example:* “Israel conducts extensive strikes as Netanyahu calls for increased force”

### Excluded Cases
- Cease-fire or hostage deals → Hostage Crisis & Cease-fire Negotiations.  
- Iran/Hezbollah front-line escalation → Iran, Hezbollah, and Regional Escalation.  
- U.S. political reaction to military plans → US-Israel diplomatic relations.

### Edge Cases
- If the *core emphasis* is U.S. pressure about an operation (e.g., “Biden warns Netanyahu against Rafah invasion”), it belongs under **US-Israel diplomatic relations**, not military strategy.
- If the article describes protests against the *operation*, but the story centers on public sentiment, code as Personal Image.


## 6. Iran, Hezbollah, and Regional Escalation

### Definition
This category captures coverage involving **cross-border threats, Hezbollah clashes, Iranian strikes, Israel’s retaliation, Syrian buffer zones, or regional alliances** beyond Gaza.

### Included Cases (Examples)
- **Warnings or threats directed at Iran or Lebanon**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu warns Lebanon of ‘destruction and suffering’”
- **Cross-border conflict with Hezbollah**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu says Israel has ‘every right’ to strike Hezbollah”
- **Strikes on Iran or Iranian-backed forces**  
  *Example:* “Israel launched strikes on Iran to roll back uranium threat”
- **Direct confrontation with Iranian leadership**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu considers targeting Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei”
- **Israeli military actions in Syria tied to Iranian influence**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu says troops will occupy a buffer zone in Syria”

### Excluded Cases
- Gaza-specific military strategy → Gaza War Military Operations.  
- Diplomatic friction with the U.S. about Iran → US-Israel diplomatic relations.  
- ICC warrants involving Netanyahu → International Legal & Diplomatic Pressure.

### Edge Cases
- **If Hezbollah is mentioned only in passing** while the article is clearly about a Gaza operation, classify under Gaza War.  
- **If Iran escalation becomes a U.S.–Israel political conflict** (e.g., Biden objecting to a strike), code it under US-Israel diplomatic relations unless the conflict itself is the focus.  
- **UN speeches mentioning Iran** count only when framed as a confrontation, not personal image.


## 7. Personal Image & Public Perception

### Definition
This category captures coverage focused on **Netanyahu’s personal reputation, symbolic behavior, and how he is perceived by domestic or international audiences**, rather than policy decisions.

### Included Cases (Examples)
- **Public protests directed at Netanyahu**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu visit sparks wave of protests in DC” 
- **Symbolic rejection such as walkouts**  
  *Example:* “U.N. delegates walk out before Netanyahu speech”  
- **Stories focusing on Netanyahu as an individual rather than policy**  
  *Example:* “Netanyahu gifts Trump golden pager”
- **Criticism of his personal commitment to hostages**  
  *Example:* “Former hostage says Netanyahu ‘forgotten’ captives”  
- **Assassination or threat narratives**  
  *Example:* “Businessman demanded $1M to kill Netanyahu” 

### Excluded Cases
- Protests about policy decisions (e.g., Rafah invasion) → classify under Gaza War Military Operations.  
- Criticism from U.S. leaders tied to diplomatic conflict (e.g., arms supply disputes) → US-Israel diplomatic relations.  
- ICC legal cases → International Legal & Diplomatic Pressure.

### Edge Cases
- **If a protest is about both Netanyahu personally and policy**, pick the dominant frame.  
- **If the article mixes image and diplomacy**, choose the category that drives the narrative.  
- Example borderline: Pelosi saying “Netanyahu should resign” focuses on his leadership status → Political Standing, *not* personal image.
